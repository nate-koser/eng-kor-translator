# Korean to English machine translation

This repository contains the necessary code to train a seq2seq model for machine translation of Korean to English. 

There were some issues:

-The dataset only contained 3500 examples, which severely limits if efficacy. We need a bigger dataset!
-My computer cannot run it for any appreciable number of epochs/batches without nearly melting my processor. Could look into an AWS instance?
